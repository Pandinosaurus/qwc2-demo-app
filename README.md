QGIS Web Client (QWC) is a modular next generation responsive web client for QGIS Server, built with ReactJS and OpenLayers.

**This repository contains an example skeleton for building a custom QWC application based on the [QWC stock application](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2).**

Consult the [QWC2 README](https://github.com/qgis/qwc2/blob/master/README.md) for information about QWC, and further links to documentation, sample viewers, etc.
